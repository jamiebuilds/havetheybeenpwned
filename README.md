# havetheybeenpwned

> Test if your user's password has been pwned using the
> [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API

[See Online](https://havetheybeenpwned.netlify.com)

- Works in modern browsers or in NodeJS
- Small: ~3kb (with included `fetch` polyfill)
- Quickly make your users' passwords more secure

## Install

```sh
npm install --save havetheybeenpwned
```

> **Note:** If you support browsers that don't
> [support WebCrypto](https://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography), you can use a
> [polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webcrypto-shim).

## Usage

```js
import pwned from "havetheybeenpwned"

pwned("hunter42").then(isPwned => {
  console.log(isPwned) // true (pwned)
})
```

That's it!

## Why you should use this

There are lots of massive data dumps floating around the internet of email and
password combos. These dumps can easily be used by bad actors (h@ck3rz) to mass
check for reused passwords on _your_ website from _your_ users.

While you can't completely break the practice of reused passwords, you can make
sure that your users are using a password that has already been compromised.

[haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a free service put
together by [Troy Hunt](https://twitter.com/troyhunt) which provides an API to
check for known compromised passwords.

This package checks that API without ever sending the full password using the
["k-anonymity" model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity).

It builds upon [Node.JS's `crypto` module](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html)
and the [WebCrypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)
to create a hash of your password of which only the first 5 encoded characters
are ever exposed. Check out the "How to build your own implementation" for full
details.

This package should take minutes to put in your application code, but if
passing a password around makes you nervous. I highly recommend implementing
this yourself.

## How to build your own implementation

In case you want to use this outside of NodeJS or the browser, here are some
instructions (with JS examples) for checking the API yourself.

If you do implement this in another language, please open a PR and link it here.

### 1. Hashing the password

For the haveibeenpwned API we'll need to create a hashed version of the
password in a format that the API expects.

- It need to be SHA-1 encoded
- And in hexidecimal format
- And in all caps

```js
import crypto from "crypto"

let hashed = crypto.createHash("sha1")
  .update(password)
  .digest("hex")
  .toUpperCase()
```

### 2. Get the "range" and "suffix"

We'll want to split the hashed password up into two parts:

- The `range` is the first 5 characters of the hashed password
- The `suffix` is all of the remaining characters after the 5th character

```js
let range = hashed.slice(0, 5)
let suffix = hashed.slice(5)
```

### 3. Fetch the `range`

Next we're going to use the `range` to search for a whole bunch of possibly
matching suffixes.

```js
let response = await fetch(`https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/${range}`)
let body = await response.text()
```

The body of the response will be in a text format like this:

```
005AB7658808E601CFBDA6B0822528E04EE:2
009A9DD8B92851C415994A6C68C3201F4D0:4

04C8D1F5884F61EBE3B890C8B9EFBB71774:19
```

### 4. Check the range for your `suffix`

Each line in the response is are the "suffixes" that match the "range" followed
by a colon and a number of times the password has been pwned.

Search for your suffix in the list. If it is present, the password has been
pwned, if itâ€™s not the password is not known to have been pwned.

```js
let regex = new RegExp(`^${suffix}:`, 'm')

regex.test(body) // true (pwned), false (not pwned)
```
